      <description>As you might have guessed I’m a linux fan, and I use it as much as possible.
Sadly 3dsmax has not been ported to Linux and I do not see any signs of it happening any time soon either.
So the last couple of days I’ve been setting up a proper VM for my development tools including 3dsmax.
It works fine, I run windows 10, and 3dsmax 2015\2016 with visual studio 2013.</description>

      <description>As you can see under ‘Open source software’ I do a lot of development for 3dsmax.
One of the most frustrating thing about that is debugging.
I’ve been fighting a couple of bugs both at work and at home, so tonight I sat down and looked for some help.
I came across this blog article:
Writing Stable 3ds Max Plugins
http://www.idigitalhouse.com/Blog/?p=243 It has some very good examples and instructions on what you can do to help you with debugging, and is really worth a read.</description>
