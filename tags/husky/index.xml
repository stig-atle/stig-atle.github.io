      <description>One bigger thing that happened last year in April was that we got a new dog! A alaskan husky, he was 8 weeks when we got him, broght our kids to get him, we drove about 4 hours one way to pick him up. The lady we got him from lived in a cabin in the woods, down a ski trail, her whole place was fenced in, and we walked up there, opened the gate, and got greated by about 5-6 huge huskys, and the puppies in the pen.</description>
