      <description>I wanted to post a bit about what I&amp;rsquo;m doing currently. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my blog. Not sure if anyone reads it anyways, but I like to sit down and write a bit every once in a while..
First - I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to replace Twitter\X with something else, so I looked around for activitypub software that I could host by my self, and I then found Snac2 - https://codeberg.</description>

      <description>One bigger thing that happened last year in April was that we got a new dog! A alaskan husky, he was 8 weeks when we got him, broght our kids to get him, we drove about 4 hours one way to pick him up. The lady we got him from lived in a cabin in the woods, down a ski trail, her whole place was fenced in, and we walked up there, opened the gate, and got greated by about 5-6 huge huskys, and the puppies in the pen.</description>
