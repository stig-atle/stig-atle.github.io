Up until that point I did not really pay any attention to mechanical keyboards, and especially not custom ones. At first I was a bit skeptical to the whole idea of getting one, because it is  a DIY compact 40% ortholinear keyboard, and I had no idea if I would like it at all.</p>
<p>After a while the keyboard got sold on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->massdrop<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I had some money in my savings account and decided to buy it. I placed the order for the sum of $141.97.</p>
<p>I ordered the version that has two separate keys where the spacebar is located.</p>
<p>The order details are :<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->CNC case color:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Silver<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plate style:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MX compatible (Cherry MX)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Keycaps:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Beige XDA PBT blanks (MX Compatible)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->49 switches:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gateron Clear (Linear)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (+$9.99)<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->sleeve:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (+$7.99)</p>
<p>I did order blank keycaps, I did not want to shell out cash for keycaps with print on then, since I can write all day long without looking on a regular keyboard. The parts arrived, and I found my soldering iron, soldered everything, assembled it all, and here is the result:</p>
<p><a href="https://stigatle.no/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/planckblank.jpg"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>This is where I have to admit the first mistake, and that was to order blank keycaps, it was really hard to learn how to type properly on it, I hated it at first. I struggled a lot learning how to use it efficiently.</p>
<p>So what I did then was to find ortholinear keycaps on amazon, I found some good ones there, ordered them and it was fantastic. Made it so much easier to use.</p>
<p>The keycaps I ordered was these:<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->DSA 40% Ortholinear dye-subbed keycap for mechanical keyboard<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Also I had to create my custom layout for it, since I’m Norwegian and need some extra letters like æøå, and also easy access to brackets and such that you use a lot when coding. That was very easy to do, I ended up using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->EasyAVR<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I stripped away to standard layout, removed all the default fancy key macros that came with the planck, and added what I needed.</p>
<p>I ended up only needing two layers, and they now look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://stigatle.no/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/01layer.jpg"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <a href="https://stigatle.no/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/02layer.jpg"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>This was the key for getting the planck exactly the way I needed, and I have now gotten rid for my old keyboard and use the planck keyboard exclusively.</p>
<p>My planck now looks like this:</p>
