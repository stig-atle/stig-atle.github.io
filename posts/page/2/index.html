      You can either download the full DVD or use the smaller netinstall boot image when installing CentOS 8. If you use the smaller netinstall boot image then you will get a error during setup that says ‘error setting up base repository’.
To fix this simply enter the url: http://mirror.centos.org/centos/8/BaseOS/x86_64/os during setup. It will then find the correct repository and get the installation started.

      After the recent blunder from MozillaI’ve decided to remove Firefox completely.
It’s become too centralized, and it’s kinda crazy that the issue happened.
What happened was that they let a certificate expire, then all addons got disabled for everyone. This even affected the Tor browser which is very scary for those who actually depend on that for circumventing censorship, and for many their lives depend on the tools they use. I have tested tons of browsers over the years, but the one I feel like switching too is Iridium ( https://iridiumbrowser.

      The reason why I bought this specific one was because of the price and features.
It has regular phone call feature, sms, fm radio, bluetooth, calendar, alarm, and is dirt cheap.
Also it charges very fast to full capacity, so if I’m out and about a power-bank will last a long time. I have to work around not being able to send\receive mms, I do that by using the online service from my provider on my computer.

      I’ve been wanting to set up Gentoo from scratch for a good while.
I have tried in the past, but failed. I decided to try again now since I have time to sit down properly with it.
Now, I will say I spent about 4 days in total on all this, multiple install attempts. I will now explain what went wrong, and what I ended up doing.
So, what I did first was to install regular Gentoo from scratch, without full-disk encryption, the initial install went fine, most things worked as they should, I then wanted to install a desktop, so I went on to installed Xfce4.

      When I saw the ortholinear mechanical keyboard named planckI just knew I had to have one. Up until that point I did not really pay any attention to mechanical keyboards, and especially not custom ones. At first I was a bit skeptical to the whole idea of getting one, because it is a DIY compact 40% ortholinear keyboard, and I had no idea if I would like it at all.

      I got contacted on twitter by @Cao_Jiayin{.ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink.u-linkComplex.js-nav} on twitter today, and he asked about a scene that I had posted previously, specifically the ‘glass monkey’ scene.

I have now re-created that scene, and exported it, zipped it, uploaded it so that you can render it out if you want to test a bit. You have to adjust ‘”integer pixelsamples” [32]’ to something much higher if you want a clean render.

      I really wanted to have CentOS on a laptop with libreboot. I had some trouble getting things to run after install, later I found a post on the libreboot website that said what to do. The same solution can be used for redhat \ fedora installs.
So here is what I did:
Download latest CentOS, boot from usb stick or some other way, personally I use drivedroidall the time , very nice app to have installed on the phone, grab the iso, copy it to phone, emulate usb cdrom and boot from that.

      I’ve been thinking about it for a long time, what should I focus on next.. I like to choose something then go for it, spend a lot of time with it until I know how it works and can use it for the things I want to do. I’ve been working with Ogre3D for the last 7 years, and now I feel the need to dive a bit deeper into real-time graphics, I never really spent time learning Direct-x or OpenGL, so after giving it some thought I decided to spend time with vulkaninstead.
