      I wanted to post a bit about what I&rsquo;m doing currently. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve updated my blog. Not sure if anyone reads it anyways, but I like to sit down and write a bit every once in a while..
First - I&rsquo;ve been wanting to replace Twitter\X with something else, so I looked around for activitypub software that I could host by my self, and I then found Snac2 - https://codeberg.

      Some days ago I wanted to try to build Yarn Desktop Client on NixOS. I installed the latest version, got some basic things set up, I then cloned my repo and instantly regretted installing NixOS, because I did not get it to work as easy as I thought. I then put my laptop away for the rest of the evening. I picked it up again the next day, determined to give it another try.

      I felt that I needed a new &lsquo;home&rsquo; for social media when I shut down gnusocial \ diaspora instances I was running. I spent some time looking around. I have to admit I do not like the whole &lsquo;web3&rsquo; stuff (nostr for example) and others, mostly because it attracts so many cryptobro&rsquo;s, and I get tired of the constant shilling they do. I do not mind crypto - I use it a lot my self, but I do not need to be reminded about it on almost every post I see on social media.

      Decided to write a bit about how things are going, I have not written much lately, so it&rsquo;s time to change that. Over Christmas my VPS provider had some hardware issues - that caused the VM to become unrecoverable. I honestly did not mind - since I had backup of everything I needed, and the current VPS I had was running a really old debian version. Also it was a pain to keep things updated, since it was set up a long time ago, so after the VPS provider installed a new fresh VM for me - I then sat down to think about how I wanted to have things in the future.

      One bigger thing that happened last year in April was that we got a new dog! A alaskan husky, he was 8 weeks when we got him, broght our kids to get him, we drove about 4 hours one way to pick him up. The lady we got him from lived in a cabin in the woods, down a ski trail, her whole place was fenced in, and we walked up there, opened the gate, and got greated by about 5-6 huge huskys, and the puppies in the pen.
