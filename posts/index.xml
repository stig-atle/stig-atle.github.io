      <description>I felt that I needed a new &amp;lsquo;home&amp;rsquo; for social media when I shut down gnusocial \ diaspora instances I was running. I spent some time looking around. I have to admit I do not like the whole &amp;lsquo;web3&amp;rsquo; stuff (nostr for example) and others, mostly because it attracts so many cryptobro&amp;rsquo;s, and I get tired of the constant shilling they do. I do not mind crypto - I use it a lot my self, but I do not need to be reminded about it on almost every post I see on social media.</description>

      <description>Decided to write a bit about how things are going, I have not written much lately, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to change that. Over Christmas my VPS provider had some hardware issues - that caused the VM to become unrecoverable. I honestly did not mind - since I had backup of everything I needed, and the current VPS I had was running a really old debian version. Also it was a pain to keep things updated, since it was set up a long time ago, so after the VPS provider installed a new fresh VM for me - I then sat down to think about how I wanted to have things in the future.</description>

      <description>One bigger thing that happened last year in April was that we got a new dog! A alaskan husky, he was 8 weeks when we got him, broght our kids to get him, we drove about 4 hours one way to pick him up. The lady we got him from lived in a cabin in the woods, down a ski trail, her whole place was fenced in, and we walked up there, opened the gate, and got greated by about 5-6 huge huskys, and the puppies in the pen.</description>

      <description>Been running these websites for a long time, but I’ve recently been having major issues with both services, and I do not have the time to get it fixed (Already spend a lot of time trying to do so). So I made the desition to shut down both sites. I have not earned anything running it it’s been running on donated hardware, but I pay with my time (and for domains).</description>

      <description>Recently I got my hands on a telescope. I finally got to set it up outside and give it a try with my kids, and I must admit I’m hooked!
I will now save up for a better one, that can be used for much more.
The current one I use is this:I was able to capture these images of the moon with it by using my phone:
Now it’s not the best quality, but I am now hooked.</description>

      <description>I have spent some time the last 4 days, wrapping my head around what the next step should be. I’ve been wanting for a long time to move it from python to c++, but I did not know how. So I decided this weekend to spend time figuring that out. The result now is that I have PBRT API available inside a python module, this again means that I can go to the next step deeper and better integration of PBRT in blender, without implementing it directly in the blender source.</description>

      <title>Install Centos 8 netinstall fails   how to fix it.</title>

      <description>You can either download the full DVD or use the smaller netinstall boot image when installing CentOS 8. If you use the smaller netinstall boot image then you will get a error during setup that says ‘error setting up base repository’.
To fix this simply enter the url: http://mirror.centos.org/centos/8/BaseOS/x86_64/os during setup. It will then find the correct repository and get the installation started.</description>

      <description>After the recent blunder from MozillaI’ve decided to remove Firefox completely.
It’s become too centralized, and it’s kinda crazy that the issue happened.
What happened was that they let a certificate expire, then all addons got disabled for everyone. This even affected the Tor browser which is very scary for those who actually depend on that for circumventing censorship, and for many their lives depend on the tools they use. I have tested tons of browsers over the years, but the one I feel like switching too is Iridium ( https://iridiumbrowser.</description>

      <description>The reason why I bought this specific one was because of the price and features.
It has regular phone call feature, sms, fm radio, bluetooth, calendar, alarm, and is dirt cheap.
Also it charges very fast to full capacity, so if I’m out and about a power-bank will last a long time. I have to work around not being able to send\receive mms, I do that by using the online service from my provider on my computer.</description>

      <description>I’ve been wanting to set up Gentoo from scratch for a good while.
I have tried in the past, but failed. I decided to try again now since I have time to sit down properly with it.
Now, I will say I spent about 4 days in total on all this, multiple install attempts. I will now explain what went wrong, and what I ended up doing.
So, what I did first was to install regular Gentoo from scratch, without full-disk encryption, the initial install went fine, most things worked as they should, I then wanted to install a desktop, so I went on to installed Xfce4.</description>

      <description>When I saw the ortholinear mechanical keyboard named planckI just knew I had to have one. Up until that point I did not really pay any attention to mechanical keyboards, and especially not custom ones. At first I was a bit skeptical to the whole idea of getting one, because it is a DIY compact 40% ortholinear keyboard, and I had no idea if I would like it at all.</description>

      <description>I got contacted on twitter by @Cao_Jiayin{.ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink.u-linkComplex.js-nav} on twitter today, and he asked about a scene that I had posted previously, specifically the ‘glass monkey’ scene.

I have now re-created that scene, and exported it, zipped it, uploaded it so that you can render it out if you want to test a bit. You have to adjust ‘”integer pixelsamples” [32]’ to something much higher if you want a clean render.</description>

      <description>I really wanted to have CentOS on a laptop with libreboot. I had some trouble getting things to run after install, later I found a post on the libreboot website that said what to do. The same solution can be used for redhat \ fedora installs.
So here is what I did:
Download latest CentOS, boot from usb stick or some other way, personally I use drivedroidall the time , very nice app to have installed on the phone, grab the iso, copy it to phone, emulate usb cdrom and boot from that.</description>

      <description>I’ve been thinking about it for a long time, what should I focus on next.. I like to choose something then go for it, spend a lot of time with it until I know how it works and can use it for the things I want to do. I’ve been working with Ogre3D for the last 7 years, and now I feel the need to dive a bit deeper into real-time graphics, I never really spent time learning Direct-x or OpenGL, so after giving it some thought I decided to spend time with vulkaninstead.</description>

      <description>I want to write a bit about my first blender development project, if you follow me on twitter then you probaly already know its a renderer exporter for PBRT render engine.
You find the source code and samples scenes here:
https://github.com/stig-atle/io_scene_pbrtThe reason why I wrote it as an exporter is because it was the easiest way to get started. The project started when I decided to stop using 3dsmax and go to blender full-time, so I needed to learn everything I needed about blenders C/Python API while making this.</description>

      <description>So, in December (2017) I decided to leave 3dsmax and switch to blender full time for all personal work. I’ve been using 3dsmax for half my life, and still use it at work (our whole workflow there is based around autodesk software), byt at home it enabled me to completely ditch window which has been a goal of mine for a long time, it was only 3dsmax holding me back.</description>

      <description>A big milestone has been reached in the LuxMax render plugin tonight, the OpenCL version now works, and uses the GPU. This means a huge speed improvement. Here is the first test render I did during the implementation. As you see the GPU sits at 46% in this example, I have tested other scenes too with 98% utilization. Also all OpenCL related settings can be tweaked in the render panel soon, this is what I’m going to fix next.</description>

      <description>A lot has happened since my last post, I’ve been working on the new exporter every day. I have come a long way, and soon it’ll be ready for beta release.
As I wrote in my previous post hereI’m rewriting everything in c++, and now I have these things mostly ready.
You can download a zipped sample project that you can load into maratis (the scene these screenshots are taken from).</description>

      <description>Around 5 years ago I found the game engine ‘Maratis’, I really liked it.
It’s easy to use, nice clean editor, nice LUA language support (which I’m used to from maxscript).
Very good for prototyping and creating games fast.
Back then I then created a exporter for 3dsmax for it, and posted a video of it here:
I then moved on to other projects.
But recent comments on the video about the exporter got me back to developing on it again, and I have now spent around two days upgrading the exporter to 3dsmax 2018, I have also rewritten most of it from maxscript to c++, so now the exporter GUI, animation modifier and physics modifier is rewritten as c++ plugins.</description>

      <guid>https://stigatle.no/posts/2017-07-10-centos-7-as-my-main-desktop-developer-os/</guid>
      <description>A couple of weeks ago I decided to give CentOS 7a try as my main OS,
the reason why is because it’s the closest you get to redhat without paying,
and I’ve been running everything from Debian to Arch, gentoo and others, but now I wanted a rock solid OS that feels predictable,
CentOS feels like the natural choice for that kind of system.
What worried me a bit was outdated software, that has been a issue before with other OS’es,</description>

      <description>I’ve been thinking about it for a long while, and now I’ve decided to invest all my free time into it.
I will integrate a renderer with Blender, first as a exporter for the file formats that the renderer uses, then
do a better integration later on when that is feature complete.
I have ditched windows completely, and with that 3dsmax. I still use 3dsmax at work every day,
but now I do not use it for anything at home.</description>

      <description>Some of you readers might already know I’m the main developer of LuxMax.
The current status is very positive, I’ve released several stable versions now and added a lot of new shaders.
The biggest improvement is stability, now you can leave the renders for days without any memory leak or such.
Also the new shaders lets you play around and create much more advanced materials then before.
This is my main focus right now add all missing shadres \ textures \ features.</description>

      <description>There is one small issue in blenderthat I’ve really disliked, and that is the rounded corners on every GUI item.
I absolutely hate rounded corners, I like it straight and flat.
So today I hunted it down in the source code and fixed it, that’s the beauty of open source fix it yourself.
You can see the difference in the screen shot here :
Left side is the rounded corners, right side is the GUI with my fix.</description>

      <description>11 pitches, 6- grade at the crux, note that several pitches are relatively short in length, that’s why there is 11 pitches, and you can easily walk down the trail from the top when done climbing.
I’ve been climbing a lot at ‘Trogfjell’ in Åmli in South Norway, I heard about the route from a climbing buddy some years ago, I found no info about it, and others have asked me recently as well about it, so I decided to write a bit about it and show where to find the start of the route.</description>

      <description>There is one thing I really missed when switching from 3dsmax to blender, and that was wire-frame on shaded view-port mode.
This is one feature I used in 3dsmax all the time, for blender you can get the same by installing this script:
http://www.pasteall.org/57345/pythonIf you are new to installing scripts, then create a file, for example ‘wireshaded.py’, then copy the text and paste it in there, make sure the indentation is correct, then go to blender’s settings\addons window, select .</description>

      <description>I frequently test and install games that are in my steam library through wine.
I run wine-staging on debian testing.
I have compiled a list of those who worked, and those that did not, I have included a steam link to each game
so that you easily can go buy\view them.
I update with new games frequently, I tag them with a date too so that you see when it was last updated easily.</description>

      <description>I wrote a post a while ago, about crossplatform workflow (text editing and code editing etc).
The old post is located here: https://stigatle.no/index.php/2016/03/09/the-quest-for-cross-platform-work-flow/After I wrote that I was still looking into other editors, and the last weeks I’ve been using Spacemacs,
and I must admit I like that the best, I now use it both at home and at work.
And it works great on windows (which I use every now and then) and on all my linux platforms.</description>

      <description>After 16 years of 3dsmax every single day I’ve started to force my self to work in blender on my own personal projects.
At work I still use 3dsmax daily, but I’ve always had an eye for blender.
The biggest reason why I find blender so intriguing is because it’s open source and free, and also it enables me to work in my favorite OS Debian.
If something is ‘wrong’ in blender I can fix it, if I need a tool I can easily add it any way I like.</description>

      <description>I’ve been thinking a lot lately, and I’ve been thinking about starting a new project that I can do for my self that is not related to Luxrender\LuxMax.
I won’t say exactly what it is yet but it’s a new plugin.
The thing I’ve been thinking of is if I should make it for 3dsmax or blender, and I’ve decided to get more into blender now.
And I want to make my next project for that.</description>

      <description>It’s no secret that I still use windows for development, and I do use visual studio.
Even though I work most of my work day (at the office) in Visual Studio I try to look at new workflows that
can benefit me both on windows and Linux.
I feel now that I have found a way for me to do this.
I ended up installing Babunon windows , and then install spf13-vimon top of that.</description>

      <description>I’m lucky enough to own a Lemote mipsellaptop.
It’s a expensive and slow piece of hardware, but the reason why I bought it is
because I value privacy, I value knowing what software I run, and where it’s from, and that
it’s the exact software I installed.
Also the hardware is a bit exotic (if you can call it that).
Everything from the Bios to the OS can be compiled from source code.</description>

      <description>Today I pushed out a new release of Luxmax internal renderer.
The open source renderer which integrates luxrender directly into 3dsmax.
We’ve been working hard the past months to get new things added.
Some of these features are:
Material preview.
Basic support for Architectural materials (Brushed metal, mirror, glass).
Matte material supports diffuse texture and bumpmap.
And many other improvements.
I made a small example render that shows the latest features.</description>

      <description>I code a lot on linux, I work mostly in Debian currently.
I often search for new tools, and I frequently try out new tools.
The last tool I’ve been spending a lot of time in is the IDE that I use.
The past days I’ve been working with debugging software on gNewSense,
and that you do there is basically pull the source, and build the package, then fix errors.</description>

      <description>Today I switched to SSL only for this website.
I think all websites should get rid of normal http traffic.
I set it up in about 2 minutes with this free SSL service:
https://letsencrypt.org/
Initially wordpress showed some error with insecure content,
that means wordpress tries to link to media over http (hardcoded probably, or theme related).
Anyways this plugin fixed it easily:</description>

      <description>It’s no secret that I’m a huge fan of open source tools.
I’ve been using Blenderfor a good while, I try to use it more and more in my own projects.
The reason why I love blender is because it’s open source, and cross-platform.
If there is a issue I can go in and fix it myself, and also it has very powerful features.
At work I do not get to use it, because we’re all on the Autodesk product line, so all the in-house tools I’ve made is for 3dsmax only.</description>

      <description>As you might have guessed I’m a linux fan, and I use it as much as possible.
Sadly 3dsmax has not been ported to Linux and I do not see any signs of it happening any time soon either.
So the last couple of days I’ve been setting up a proper VM for my development tools including 3dsmax.
It works fine, I run windows 10, and 3dsmax 2015\2016 with visual studio 2013.</description>

      <description>As you can see under ‘Open source software’ I do a lot of development for 3dsmax.
One of the most frustrating thing about that is debugging.
I’ve been fighting a couple of bugs both at work and at home, so tonight I sat down and looked for some help.
I came across this blog article:
Writing Stable 3ds Max Plugins
http://www.idigitalhouse.com/Blog/?p=243 It has some very good examples and instructions on what you can do to help you with debugging, and is really worth a read.</description>
