    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I wanted to post a bit about what I&rsquo;m doing currently. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve updated my blog.
Not sure if anyone reads it anyways, but I like to sit down and write a bit every once in a while..</p>
<p>First - I&rsquo;ve been wanting to replace Twitter\X with something else, so I looked around for activitypub software
that I could host by my self, and I then found Snac2 - <a href="https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2">https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2</a>
I run a instance now - <a href="https://activitypub.stigatle.no/stigatle/">https://activitypub.stigatle.no/stigatle/</a> , and can be followed through @stigatle@activitypub.stigatle.no
Over time I&rsquo;ve found many of the people I follow on Twitter\X in the fediverse, and started to follow them on activitypub instead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working a lot, but also I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time training our Husky, mainly with bicycle.
It&rsquo;s been really fun doing that, and the most fun part about it - is that he knew the right\left commands
early on, so I can just tell him where to go - and he goes that way.</p>
<p>I have been looking for a place to ride with him that is gravel, and long enough for him to 
really test his skills, and I have now found that, so one of these days I&rsquo;ll go there to have him run like never before.</p>
<p>Other then that - as you might know - we have two kids, that also takes up a lot of my free time, especially now since
our Son started with football, we tried that about a year ago, but he was not motivated, but he came home some months ago
and asked if he could go with his friend to football pratice, we said yes, and he had a really great time, he then joined the 
team and goes to all the training and matches that they play, it&rsquo;s been really great for him.</p>
<p>And our daughter will start with Volleyball soon, that is someething she has wanted for a while, and we found a location
where they do that, so I&rsquo;m really looking forward to that too :)</p>
<p>As for coding and such - I&rsquo;ve been actively working on my desktop client ( <a href="https://github.com/stig-atle/YarnDesktopClient">https://github.com/stig-atle/YarnDesktopClient</a> ), 
which is a client for <a href="https://yarn.social">https://yarn.social</a> instances , been adding more and more missing features,
the latest is clickable links, and media upload. Still a lot of work to do - but it&rsquo;s really nice to get these 
features added. Currently it uses GTK4, but I am always considering other options, lately I&rsquo;ve been thinkin about flutter.
But I have limited time, and I do like to work with GTK4, so I will most likely stick with GTK4 for now.</p>
<p>One thing that I do have planned though, is to make the software work on OpenBSD, that is someething I&rsquo;d really like to do.</p>
<p>The last thing is NixOS - in my previous post I mentioned that I switched to NixOS, but there was some issues getting It
set up to how I need it, and I honesly do not have more time for it, so I decided to go back to Debian.
So all my software development right now is done on that instead.</p>
