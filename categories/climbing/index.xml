      <description>11 pitches, 6- grade at the crux, note that several pitches are relatively short in length, that’s why there is 11 pitches, and you can easily walk down the trail from the top when done climbing.
I’ve been climbing a lot at ‘Trogfjell’ in Åmli in South Norway, I heard about the route from a climbing buddy some years ago, I found no info about it, and others have asked me recently as well about it, so I decided to write a bit about it and show where to find the start of the route.</description>
