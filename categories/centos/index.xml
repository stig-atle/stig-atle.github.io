      <description>I really wanted to have CentOS on a laptop with libreboot. I had some trouble getting things to run after install, later I found a post on the libreboot website that said what to do. The same solution can be used for redhat \ fedora installs.
So here is what I did:
Download latest CentOS, boot from usb stick or some other way, personally I use drivedroidall the time , very nice app to have installed on the phone, grab the iso, copy it to phone, emulate usb cdrom and boot from that.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I decided to give CentOS 7a try as my main OS,
the reason why is because it’s the closest you get to redhat without paying,
and I’ve been running everything from Debian to Arch, gentoo and others, but now I wanted a rock solid OS that feels predictable,
CentOS feels like the natural choice for that kind of system.
What worried me a bit was outdated software, that has been a issue before with other OS’es,</description>
