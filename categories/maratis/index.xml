      <description>A lot has happened since my last post, I’ve been working on the new exporter every day. I have come a long way, and soon it’ll be ready for beta release.
As I wrote in my previous post hereI’m rewriting everything in c++, and now I have these things mostly ready.
You can download a zipped sample project that you can load into maratis (the scene these screenshots are taken from).</description>

      <description>Around 5 years ago I found the game engine ‘Maratis’, I really liked it.
It’s easy to use, nice clean editor, nice LUA language support (which I’m used to from maxscript).
Very good for prototyping and creating games fast.
Back then I then created a exporter for 3dsmax for it, and posted a video of it here:
I then moved on to other projects.
But recent comments on the video about the exporter got me back to developing on it again, and I have now spent around two days upgrading the exporter to 3dsmax 2018, I have also rewritten most of it from maxscript to c++, so now the exporter GUI, animation modifier and physics modifier is rewritten as c++ plugins.</description>
