      <description>A couple of weeks ago I decided to give CentOS 7a try as my main OS,
the reason why is because it’s the closest you get to redhat without paying,
and I’ve been running everything from Debian to Arch, gentoo and others, but now I wanted a rock solid OS that feels predictable,
CentOS feels like the natural choice for that kind of system.
What worried me a bit was outdated software, that has been a issue before with other OS’es,</description>

      <title>Switched to SSL only</title>

      <description>Today I switched to SSL only for this website.
I think all websites should get rid of normal http traffic.
I set it up in about 2 minutes with this free SSL service:
https://letsencrypt.org/
Initially wordpress showed some error with insecure content,
that means wordpress tries to link to media over http (hardcoded probably, or theme related).
Anyways this plugin fixed it easily:</description>
