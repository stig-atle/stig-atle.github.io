      <description>I want to write a bit about my first blender development project, if you follow me on twitter then you probaly already know its a renderer exporter for PBRT render engine.
You find the source code and samples scenes here:
https://github.com/stig-atle/io_scene_pbrtThe reason why I wrote it as an exporter is because it was the easiest way to get started. The project started when I decided to stop using 3dsmax and go to blender full-time, so I needed to learn everything I needed about blenders C/Python API while making this.</description>

      <description>So, in December (2017) I decided to leave 3dsmax and switch to blender full time for all personal work. I’ve been using 3dsmax for half my life, and still use it at work (our whole workflow there is based around autodesk software), byt at home it enabled me to completely ditch window which has been a goal of mine for a long time, it was only 3dsmax holding me back.</description>

      <title>LuxMax 3DsMax 2018 OpenCL</title>

      <description>A big milestone has been reached in the LuxMax render plugin tonight, the OpenCL version now works, and uses the GPU. This means a huge speed improvement. Here is the first test render I did during the implementation. As you see the GPU sits at 46% in this example, I have tested other scenes too with 98% utilization. Also all OpenCL related settings can be tweaked in the render panel soon, this is what I’m going to fix next.</description>

      <description>A lot has happened since my last post, I’ve been working on the new exporter every day. I have come a long way, and soon it’ll be ready for beta release.
As I wrote in my previous post hereI’m rewriting everything in c++, and now I have these things mostly ready.
You can download a zipped sample project that you can load into maratis (the scene these screenshots are taken from).</description>

      <title>Maratis scene exporter for 3dsmax status update</title>

      <description>Around 5 years ago I found the game engine ‘Maratis’, I really liked it.
It’s easy to use, nice clean editor, nice LUA language support (which I’m used to from maxscript).
Very good for prototyping and creating games fast.
Back then I then created a exporter for 3dsmax for it, and posted a video of it here:
I then moved on to other projects.
But recent comments on the video about the exporter got me back to developing on it again, and I have now spent around two days upgrading the exporter to 3dsmax 2018, I have also rewritten most of it from maxscript to c++, so now the exporter GUI, animation modifier and physics modifier is rewritten as c++ plugins.</description>

      <description>I’ve been thinking about it for a long while, and now I’ve decided to invest all my free time into it.
I will integrate a renderer with Blender, first as a exporter for the file formats that the renderer uses, then
do a better integration later on when that is feature complete.
I have ditched windows completely, and with that 3dsmax. I still use 3dsmax at work every day,
but now I do not use it for anything at home.</description>

      <description>Some of you readers might already know I’m the main developer of LuxMax.
The current status is very positive, I’ve released several stable versions now and added a lot of new shaders.
The biggest improvement is stability, now you can leave the renders for days without any memory leak or such.
Also the new shaders lets you play around and create much more advanced materials then before.
This is my main focus right now add all missing shadres \ textures \ features.</description>

      <title>Blender   wireframe on shaded</title>

      <description>There is one thing I really missed when switching from 3dsmax to blender, and that was wire-frame on shaded view-port mode.
This is one feature I used in 3dsmax all the time, for blender you can get the same by installing this script:
http://www.pasteall.org/57345/pythonIf you are new to installing scripts, then create a file, for example ‘wireshaded.py’, then copy the text and paste it in there, make sure the indentation is correct, then go to blender’s settings\addons window, select .</description>

      <description>After 16 years of 3dsmax every single day I’ve started to force my self to work in blender on my own personal projects.
At work I still use 3dsmax daily, but I’ve always had an eye for blender.
The biggest reason why I find blender so intriguing is because it’s open source and free, and also it enables me to work in my favorite OS Debian.
If something is ‘wrong’ in blender I can fix it, if I need a tool I can easily add it any way I like.</description>

      <title>New release of Luxmax internal renderer for 3dsmax</title>
      <link>https://stigatle.no/posts/2016-02-20-new-release-of-luxmax-internal-renderer-for-3dsmax/</link>

      <guid>https://stigatle.no/posts/2016-02-20-new-release-of-luxmax-internal-renderer-for-3dsmax/</guid>
      <description>Today I pushed out a new release of Luxmax internal renderer.
The open source renderer which integrates luxrender directly into 3dsmax.
We’ve been working hard the past months to get new things added.
Some of these features are:
Material preview.
Basic support for Architectural materials (Brushed metal, mirror, glass).
Matte material supports diffuse texture and bumpmap.
And many other improvements.
I made a small example render that shows the latest features.</description>

      <title>3dsmax in virtualbox on Linux.</title>

      <description>As you might have guessed I’m a linux fan, and I use it as much as possible.
Sadly 3dsmax has not been ported to Linux and I do not see any signs of it happening any time soon either.
So the last couple of days I’ve been setting up a proper VM for my development tools including 3dsmax.
It works fine, I run windows 10, and 3dsmax 2015\2016 with visual studio 2013.</description>
