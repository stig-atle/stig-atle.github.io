      <description>Been running these websites for a long time, but I’ve recently been having major issues with both services, and I do not have the time to get it fixed (Already spend a lot of time trying to do so). So I made the desition to shut down both sites. I have not earned anything running it it’s been running on donated hardware, but I pay with my time (and for domains).</description>

      <description>Recently I got my hands on a telescope. I finally got to set it up outside and give it a try with my kids, and I must admit I’m hooked!
I will now save up for a better one, that can be used for much more.
The current one I use is this:I was able to capture these images of the moon with it by using my phone:
Now it’s not the best quality, but I am now hooked.</description>

      <description>I have spent some time the last 4 days, wrapping my head around what the next step should be. I’ve been wanting for a long time to move it from python to c++, but I did not know how. So I decided this weekend to spend time figuring that out. The result now is that I have PBRT API available inside a python module, this again means that I can go to the next step deeper and better integration of PBRT in blender, without implementing it directly in the blender source.</description>

      <title>Install Centos 8 netinstall fails   how to fix it.</title>
      <link>https://stigatle.no/posts/2019-11-04-install-centos-8-netboot-image/</link>

      <description>You can either download the full DVD or use the smaller netinstall boot image when installing CentOS 8. If you use the smaller netinstall boot image then you will get a error during setup that says ‘error setting up base repository’.
To fix this simply enter the url: http://mirror.centos.org/centos/8/BaseOS/x86_64/os during setup. It will then find the correct repository and get the installation started.</description>

      <title>Dropping firefox.</title>

      <description>After the recent blunder from MozillaI’ve decided to remove Firefox completely.
It’s become too centralized, and it’s kinda crazy that the issue happened.
What happened was that they let a certificate expire, then all addons got disabled for everyone. This even affected the Tor browser which is very scary for those who actually depend on that for circumventing censorship, and for many their lives depend on the tools they use. I have tested tons of browsers over the years, but the one I feel like switching too is Iridium ( https://iridiumbrowser.</description>

      <title>Gentoo</title>

      <description>I’ve been wanting to set up Gentoo from scratch for a good while.
I have tried in the past, but failed. I decided to try again now since I have time to sit down properly with it.
Now, I will say I spent about 4 days in total on all this, multiple install attempts. I will now explain what went wrong, and what I ended up doing.
So, what I did first was to install regular Gentoo from scratch, without full-disk encryption, the initial install went fine, most things worked as they should, I then wanted to install a desktop, so I went on to installed Xfce4.</description>

      <title>Planck mechanical keyboard.</title>

      <description>When I saw the ortholinear mechanical keyboard named planckI just knew I had to have one. Up until that point I did not really pay any attention to mechanical keyboards, and especially not custom ones. At first I was a bit skeptical to the whole idea of getting one, because it is a DIY compact 40% ortholinear keyboard, and I had no idea if I would like it at all.</description>

      <description>As you can see under ‘Open source software’ I do a lot of development for 3dsmax.
One of the most frustrating thing about that is debugging.
I’ve been fighting a couple of bugs both at work and at home, so tonight I sat down and looked for some help.
I came across this blog article:
Writing Stable 3ds Max Plugins
http://www.idigitalhouse.com/Blog/?p=243 It has some very good examples and instructions on what you can do to help you with debugging, and is really worth a read.</description>
