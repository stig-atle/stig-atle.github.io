      <description>The reason why I bought this specific one was because of the price and features.
It has regular phone call feature, sms, fm radio, bluetooth, calendar, alarm, and is dirt cheap.
Also it charges very fast to full capacity, so if I’m out and about a power-bank will last a long time. I have to work around not being able to send\receive mms, I do that by using the online service from my provider on my computer.</description>

      <title>Gentoo</title>

      <description>I’ve been wanting to set up Gentoo from scratch for a good while.
I have tried in the past, but failed. I decided to try again now since I have time to sit down properly with it.
Now, I will say I spent about 4 days in total on all this, multiple install attempts. I will now explain what went wrong, and what I ended up doing.
So, what I did first was to install regular Gentoo from scratch, without full-disk encryption, the initial install went fine, most things worked as they should, I then wanted to install a desktop, so I went on to installed Xfce4.</description>

      <guid>https://stigatle.no/posts/2018-05-28-learning-vulkan/</guid>
      <description>I’ve been thinking about it for a long time, what should I focus on next.. I like to choose something then go for it, spend a lot of time with it until I know how it works and can use it for the things I want to do. I’ve been working with Ogre3D for the last 7 years, and now I feel the need to dive a bit deeper into real-time graphics, I never really spent time learning Direct-x or OpenGL, so after giving it some thought I decided to spend time with vulkaninstead.</description>

      <description>I want to write a bit about my first blender development project, if you follow me on twitter then you probaly already know its a renderer exporter for PBRT render engine.
You find the source code and samples scenes here:
https://github.com/stig-atle/io_scene_pbrtThe reason why I wrote it as an exporter is because it was the easiest way to get started. The project started when I decided to stop using 3dsmax and go to blender full-time, so I needed to learn everything I needed about blenders C/Python API while making this.</description>

      <title>Switching to blender on all personal projects.</title>

      <description>So, in December (2017) I decided to leave 3dsmax and switch to blender full time for all personal work. I’ve been using 3dsmax for half my life, and still use it at work (our whole workflow there is based around autodesk software), byt at home it enabled me to completely ditch window which has been a goal of mine for a long time, it was only 3dsmax holding me back.</description>

      <title>Testing CentOS 7 as desktop \ developer OS.</title>
      <link>https://stigatle.no/posts/2017-07-10-centos-7-as-my-main-desktop-developer-os/</link>

      <guid>https://stigatle.no/posts/2017-07-10-centos-7-as-my-main-desktop-developer-os/</guid>
      <description>A couple of weeks ago I decided to give CentOS 7a try as my main OS,
the reason why is because it’s the closest you get to redhat without paying,
and I’ve been running everything from Debian to Arch, gentoo and others, but now I wanted a rock solid OS that feels predictable,
CentOS feels like the natural choice for that kind of system.
What worried me a bit was outdated software, that has been a issue before with other OS’es,</description>

      <guid>https://stigatle.no/posts/2017-06-07-my-new-project/</guid>
      <description>I’ve been thinking about it for a long while, and now I’ve decided to invest all my free time into it.
I will integrate a renderer with Blender, first as a exporter for the file formats that the renderer uses, then
do a better integration later on when that is feature complete.
I have ditched windows completely, and with that 3dsmax. I still use 3dsmax at work every day,
but now I do not use it for anything at home.</description>

      <title>Steam games for windows that works with Wine on Linux</title>

      <guid>https://stigatle.no/posts/2016-08-02-steam-games-for-windows-that-works-with-wine-on-linux/</guid>
      <description>I frequently test and install games that are in my steam library through wine.
I run wine-staging on debian testing.
I have compiled a list of those who worked, and those that did not, I have included a steam link to each game
so that you easily can go buy\view them.
I update with new games frequently, I tag them with a date too so that you see when it was last updated easily.</description>

      <title>The quest for cross-platform work-flow follow-up</title>

      <description>I wrote a post a while ago, about crossplatform workflow (text editing and code editing etc).
The old post is located here: https://stigatle.no/index.php/2016/03/09/the-quest-for-cross-platform-work-flow/After I wrote that I was still looking into other editors, and the last weeks I’ve been using Spacemacs,
and I must admit I like that the best, I now use it both at home and at work.
And it works great on windows (which I use every now and then) and on all my linux platforms.</description>

      <description>After 16 years of 3dsmax every single day I’ve started to force my self to work in blender on my own personal projects.
At work I still use 3dsmax daily, but I’ve always had an eye for blender.
The biggest reason why I find blender so intriguing is because it’s open source and free, and also it enables me to work in my favorite OS Debian.
If something is ‘wrong’ in blender I can fix it, if I need a tool I can easily add it any way I like.</description>

      <description>I’ve been thinking a lot lately, and I’ve been thinking about starting a new project that I can do for my self that is not related to Luxrender\LuxMax.
I won’t say exactly what it is yet but it’s a new plugin.
The thing I’ve been thinking of is if I should make it for 3dsmax or blender, and I’ve decided to get more into blender now.
And I want to make my next project for that.</description>

      <description>It’s no secret that I still use windows for development, and I do use visual studio.
Even though I work most of my work day (at the office) in Visual Studio I try to look at new workflows that
can benefit me both on windows and Linux.
I feel now that I have found a way for me to do this.
I ended up installing Babunon windows , and then install spf13-vimon top of that.</description>

      <description>I’m lucky enough to own a Lemote mipsellaptop.
It’s a expensive and slow piece of hardware, but the reason why I bought it is
because I value privacy, I value knowing what software I run, and where it’s from, and that
it’s the exact software I installed.
Also the hardware is a bit exotic (if you can call it that).
Everything from the Bios to the OS can be compiled from source code.</description>

      <description>I code a lot on linux, I work mostly in Debian currently.
I often search for new tools, and I frequently try out new tools.
The last tool I’ve been spending a lot of time in is the IDE that I use.
The past days I’ve been working with debugging software on gNewSense,
and that you do there is basically pull the source, and build the package, then fix errors.</description>

      <title>Switched to SSL only</title>

      <guid>https://stigatle.no/posts/2015-12-20-switched-to-ssl-only/</guid>
      <description>Today I switched to SSL only for this website.
I think all websites should get rid of normal http traffic.
I set it up in about 2 minutes with this free SSL service:
https://letsencrypt.org/
Initially wordpress showed some error with insecure content,
that means wordpress tries to link to media over http (hardcoded probably, or theme related).
Anyways this plugin fixed it easily:</description>

      <title>Blender plugin   Hard ops</title>

      <guid>https://stigatle.no/posts/2015-12-20-blender-plugin-hard-ops/</guid>
      <description>It’s no secret that I’m a huge fan of open source tools.
I’ve been using Blenderfor a good while, I try to use it more and more in my own projects.
The reason why I love blender is because it’s open source, and cross-platform.
If there is a issue I can go in and fix it myself, and also it has very powerful features.
At work I do not get to use it, because we’re all on the Autodesk product line, so all the in-house tools I’ve made is for 3dsmax only.</description>

      <title>3dsmax in virtualbox on Linux.</title>

      <description>As you might have guessed I’m a linux fan, and I use it as much as possible.
Sadly 3dsmax has not been ported to Linux and I do not see any signs of it happening any time soon either.
So the last couple of days I’ve been setting up a proper VM for my development tools including 3dsmax.
It works fine, I run windows 10, and 3dsmax 2015\2016 with visual studio 2013.</description>
