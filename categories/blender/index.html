      I got contacted on twitter by @Cao_Jiayin{.ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink.u-linkComplex.js-nav} on twitter today, and he asked about a scene that I had posted previously, specifically the ‘glass monkey’ scene.

I have now re-created that scene, and exported it, zipped it, uploaded it so that you can render it out if you want to test a bit. You have to adjust ‘”integer pixelsamples” [32]’ to something much higher if you want a clean render.

      I want to write a bit about my first blender development project, if you follow me on twitter then you probaly already know its a renderer exporter for PBRT render engine.
You find the source code and samples scenes here:
https://github.com/stig-atle/io_scene_pbrtThe reason why I wrote it as an exporter is because it was the easiest way to get started. The project started when I decided to stop using 3dsmax and go to blender full-time, so I needed to learn everything I needed about blenders C/Python API while making this.

      So, in December (2017) I decided to leave 3dsmax and switch to blender full time for all personal work. I’ve been using 3dsmax for half my life, and still use it at work (our whole workflow there is based around autodesk software), byt at home it enabled me to completely ditch window which has been a goal of mine for a long time, it was only 3dsmax holding me back.

      A couple of weeks ago I decided to give CentOS 7a try as my main OS,
the reason why is because it’s the closest you get to redhat without paying,
and I’ve been running everything from Debian to Arch, gentoo and others, but now I wanted a rock solid OS that feels predictable,
CentOS feels like the natural choice for that kind of system.
What worried me a bit was outdated software, that has been a issue before with other OS’es,

      I’ve been thinking about it for a long while, and now I’ve decided to invest all my free time into it.
I will integrate a renderer with Blender, first as a exporter for the file formats that the renderer uses, then
do a better integration later on when that is feature complete.
I have ditched windows completely, and with that 3dsmax. I still use 3dsmax at work every day,
but now I do not use it for anything at home.

      There is one small issue in blenderthat I’ve really disliked, and that is the rounded corners on every GUI item.
I absolutely hate rounded corners, I like it straight and flat.
So today I hunted it down in the source code and fixed it, that’s the beauty of open source fix it yourself.
You can see the difference in the screen shot here :
Left side is the rounded corners, right side is the GUI with my fix.

This is one feature I used in 3dsmax all the time, for blender you can get the same by installing this script:
http://www.pasteall.org/57345/pythonIf you are new to installing scripts, then create a file, for example ‘wireshaded.py’, then copy the text and paste it in there, make sure the indentation is correct, then go to blender’s settings\addons window, select .

      After 16 years of 3dsmax every single day I’ve started to force my self to work in blender on my own personal projects.
At work I still use 3dsmax daily, but I’ve always had an eye for blender.
The biggest reason why I find blender so intriguing is because it’s open source and free, and also it enables me to work in my favorite OS Debian.
If something is ‘wrong’ in blender I can fix it, if I need a tool I can easily add it any way I like.

      It’s no secret that I’m a huge fan of open source tools.
I’ve been using Blenderfor a good while, I try to use it more and more in my own projects.
The reason why I love blender is because it’s open source, and cross-platform.
If there is a issue I can go in and fix it myself, and also it has very powerful features.
At work I do not get to use it, because we’re all on the Autodesk product line, so all the in-house tools I’ve made is for 3dsmax only.
